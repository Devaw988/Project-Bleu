# Project-Bleu
Custom Low Cost Macro Pad with tons of features and customizations based around the pro-micro, an affordable MCU. 

Total cost of build:
- PCB Version: 25$
- non PCB Version: 20$

*Need Access to 3D printer inorder to print housings. Total weight of filament used is around 80g.

Features:
- 12 Keys
- .91'' Oled
- Rotary Encoder
- Individually addressable RGB
- User programmable layers
- Ultra compact form factor at 112x67mm
- Highly customizable backplate allowing for creative designs


Notes:
1. There are 2 verions of the macropad. A one with a PCB and one without. The PCB version allows for housing swaps (IE the outside case can be swapped at any time without desoldering or messing with the electronics) which allows users to change the look of their macropad with the look of their setups.
2. The PCB version is far easier to build, infact I would caution against the hand solder version unless you are experianced with soldering.
